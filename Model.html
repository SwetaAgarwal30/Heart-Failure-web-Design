            <h2>1. Logistic Regression</h2>
            <p>Logistic Regression is used to solve the classification problems in machine learning. 
                They are similar to linear regression but used to predict the categorical variables.
                 It can predict the output in either Yes or No, 0 or 1, True or False, etc. However, 
                 rather than giving the exact values, it provides the probabilistic values between 0 & 1.

            <h2>2. RandomForest Classifier </h2>
            <p>Random Forest is the ensemble learning method, which consists of a large number of decision trees. 
                Each decision tree in a random forest predicts an outcome, and the prediction with the majority 
                of votes is considered as the outcome.
                A random forest model can be used for both regression and classification problems.

            <h2>3.SVM</h2>
            <p>Support vector machine or SVM is the popular machine learning algorithm, which is widely 
                used for classification and regression tasks. However, specifically, it is used to solve 
                classification problems. The main aim of SVM is to find the best decision boundaries in an 
                N-dimensional space, which can segregate data points into classes, and the best decision 
                boundary is known as Hyperplane. SVM selects the extreme vector to find the hyperplane, 
                and these vectors are known as support vectors.

            <h2>4.GradientBoosting Classifier</h2>
            <p>Gradient boosting is a machine learning ensemble technique that combines the predictions of multiple
                weak learners, typically decision trees, sequentially. It aims to improve overall predictive 
                performance by optimizing the model’s weights based on the errors of previous iterations, 
                gradually reducing prediction errors and enhancing the model’s accuracy.

            <h2>5.Decision Tree</h2>
            <p>Decision trees are also classifiers that are used to determine what category an input falls 
                into by traversing the leaf's and nodes of a tree.A decision tree uses a tree-like structure of 
                decisions along with their possible consequences and outcomes. In this, each internal node is used 
                to represent a test on an attribute; each branch is used to represent the outcome of the test. 
                The more nodes a decision tree has, the more accurate the result will be.

            <h2>6.Naive Bayes</h2>
            <p>Naive Bayes is an algorithm that assumes independence among variables and uses probability 
                to classify objects based on features.Each naïve Bayes classifier assumes that the value of a 
                specific variable is independent of any other variable/feature. For example, if a fruit needs 
                to be classified based on color, shape, and taste. So yellow, oval, and sweet will be recognized 
                as mango. Here each feature is independent of other features.
